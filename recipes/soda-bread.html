    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Irish soda bread is a beloved staple in Irish cuisine, cherished for its simplicity, hearty texture, and distinctive flavor. Traditionally made with just four basic ingredients – flour, baking soda, salt, and buttermilk – this rustic loaf has been a cornerstone of Irish baking for centuries. Its humble origins stem from the need for a quick and easy bread that could be prepared without yeast, making it accessible to households of all means. The baking soda reacts with the acidic buttermilk to create carbon dioxide bubbles, resulting in a light and tender crumb with a slightly tangy taste.</p>
    <p>Characterized by its signature cross cut into the top, Irish soda bread is both practical and symbolic. The cross serves a functional purpose, allowing the bread to expand and bake evenly, while also representing blessings and warding off evil spirits, according to Irish folklore. Beyond its cultural significance, Irish soda bread embodies a sense of warmth and comfort, evoking memories of cozy kitchens and shared meals. Whether served fresh from the oven with a generous slathering of butter or alongside a hearty stew, this timeless classic continues to hold a special place in Irish hearts and tables, celebrated for its humble origins and enduring appeal.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup margarine or butter, softened</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>>1 large egg</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>¼ cup buttermilk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, softened margarine, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir in 1 cup of buttermilk and egg. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead slightly. Form dough into a round loaf and place on the prepared baking sheet. Note that the dough will be a little sticky.</li>
        <li>Combine melted butter with 1/4 cup buttermilk in a small bowl; brush loaf with this mixture. Use a sharp knife to cut an 'X' into the top of the loaf.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Check for doneness after 30 minutes. You may continue to brush the loaf with the butter mixture while it bakes.</li>
    </ol>
