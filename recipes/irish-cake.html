    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray with flour</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped pecans</li>
        <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix</li>
        <li>1 (3.4 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>¾ cup Irish cream liqueur</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt pan with cooking spray. Sprinkle chopped nuts evenly over the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Combine cake mix and pudding mix in a large bowl. Beat in eggs, Irish cream liqueur, oil, and water with an electric mixer on high speed for 5 minutes. Pour batter over nuts in the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>While cake is cooling, make glaze: Combine sugar, butter, and water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil and continue boiling for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in Irish cream.</li>
        <li>>Invert cake onto a serving dish. Prick the top and sides of cake with a toothpick. Spoon glaze over the top and brush onto the sides. Allow cake to absorb glaze, then repeat until glaze is used up.</li>
    </ol>
